# Atomic Habit Tracker

*Project still in development

Users are able to track specific habits by allowing them to enter habit details such as habit title, duration, frequency, etc. into a form. When the form is submitted the new habit is displayed in a list of habits which can be tracked using chechboxes for each day. The idea is based on the book, *Atomic Habits*, by James Clear (I highly recommend).

## Technologies
- React.js
- Node.js
- MongoDB/Mongoose
- Express
- JSON Web Tokens
- bcrypt
- Axios
- Styled-components library

## Features
- JWT Authentication/Authorization upon user registration or login using HTTP only cookies
- Saves and updates encrypted user login and habit information in a MongoDB database
- Users can edit or delete habits they created

## More About the Project and What I Learned
My main learning goal in this project was to build an app that utilizes both front-end and back-end technologies while also implementing secure and encrypted data storage and transfer. I gained a better understanding of how data is collected, sent and received between the client and server. I also extended my knowledge of using React hooks and components hopefully keeping my code "dry" and clean. 

When I first read *Atomic Habits* my immediate thought was, how could I create a technology that might help people better track their progress by using techniques specifically mentioned in the book. I came up with a plan of what I wanted to create on the client side without using any kind of tutorial on how to build a habit tracker.  

## Improvements and Possible Future Features
- Send habit notifications/reminders to users
- Tips and tricks "hints" for better habit building specifically from the book 
- Inspirational daily quotes displayed on the home page
- Users can edit or delete user profile in the database
- Responsive design
